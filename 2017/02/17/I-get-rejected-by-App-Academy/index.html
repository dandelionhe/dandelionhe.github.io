    <h1 id="I-get-rejected-by-App-Academy"><a href="#I-get-rejected-by-App-Academy" class="headerlink" title="I get rejected by App Academy"></a>I get rejected by App Academy</h1><p>After two technical interviews and one non technical interview , I get rejected by App Academy today, February 17, 2017.</p>
<p>I do feel a little bit upset, even although I had made up mind that I am not going to attend the bootcamp if getting accepted. Three months (bootcamp prefers 12 weeks just make you feel like the training is long enough for you to reborn and totally change) in fact will not change a person too much, App Academy only choosing candidates who are just good enough especially good enough in background to success. I get rejected means that I am in disadvantage position on the job market right now, I really have to work harder in order to stand out. I knew it. So I am upset, a little bit. I am still going to work on web development.</p>
<p>Things about this journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really do appreciate App Academy. They have a very good curriculum on introducing ruby, although it is very basic. I totally fall in love with ruby after that.</li>
<li><p>App Academy is a startup. There is no magic here. My judgment may not be fair, since I have never make it. The conclusion is came from my observation. The founder Kush Patel created it after he took a training class of programming, so are the founders of Hack Reactor. Nothing fancy. By their description, only one or two hours a day will have lectures while the rest is pair programming, learning from each other who are just as ignorant as you in programming. In hack reactor, there are so many students,  they even ask you to watch videos. They claimed learning in this way will give you more time to practice so you can learn 10x faster. In fact when I was attending the jump start class, which is a prep program, I got very bad experiences from it. My partner had no experiences, so did I and the TAs are not helpful at all, they are just graduated months ago and before that they are just like you. They stuck on simple things too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t believe in bootcamp advertisment . The one in successful story is going to success anyway. And there is no magic, I have to study hard, work hard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I need to keep writing things from today. I need to build up my portfolios. </p>
</li>
</ul>
